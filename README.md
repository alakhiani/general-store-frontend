## Getting Started

To get started with the General Store frontend, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- npm: npm is installed with Node.js. If you have Node.js installed, you have npm installed as well.
